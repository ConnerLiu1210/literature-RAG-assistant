## ⚙️ Tech Stack

### Frontend
- Streamlit

### Backend
- Python

### AI / NLP
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Sentence Transformers
- Semantic Search
- Query Rewriting

### Vector Database
- FAISS

### LLM
- Claude (Azure Anthropic API)

### PDF Processing

## ✨ Core Pipeline

### 1. PDF Loading

Research papers are uploaded and parsed into page-level text.

### 2. Text Chunking

Documents are split into overlapping chunks to preserve context during retrieval.

### 3. Embedding Generation

Each chunk is converted into a dense vector representation using Sentence Transformers.

### 4. Vector Search

Relevant chunks are retrieved with semantic similarity search through FAISS.

### 5. Prompt Construction

Retrieved passages are combined into a structured prompt with source information.

### 6. Answer Generation

Claude generates a grounded answer based only on the retrieved evidence.

### 7. Source Attribution

The application displays page-level citations and supporting excerpts.
